# Regression-Analysis

This repo explores how regression techniques can be used to simplify complex data relationships, interpret trends, and build predictive models in Python.

### Simple Linear Regression:
Build, evaluate, and interpret linear regression models.

### Multiple Linear Regression:
Multivariable regression, feature engineering (e.g., categorical encoding), and regularization techniques like Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

### Advanced Hypothesis Testing:
Chi-squared tests, one-way and two-way ANOVA, ANCOVA, and MANOVA to support statistical inference.

### Logistic Regression: 
Build classification models (binary & multinomial), evaluate model performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and interpret model coefficients in Python.
