## Overview

- The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction.They would like to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data.

## Results

Customers who rated in-flight entertainment highly were more likely to be satisfied. Improving in-flight entertainment should lead to better customer satisfaction. The model is 80.2 percent accurate. This is an improvement over the dataset's customer satisfaction rate of 54.7 percent. The success of the model suggests that the airline should invest more in model developement to examine if adding more independent variables leads to better results. Building this model could not only be useful in predicting whether or not a customer would be satisfied but also lead to a better understanding of what independent variables lead to happier customers.
